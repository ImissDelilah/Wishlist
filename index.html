        <p>There's the Bambu Lab p1p which is a good pick it has a big print bed, has auto calibration, has vibration compensation (making print’s faster), and is easy to upgrade
also would be good is some filament for it, abs and petg hf (or pla) would be nice and easy to use. you can get it cheaper buying more just look at their but in bulk sales (you can save buying 4-7 or 8+ rolls) and if you get 4 basic filament refills (or non mix match of “cosmetic” which I don’t want) you can get a free spool (which I only need one so doing it this way would get me filament and a usable spool)</p>
